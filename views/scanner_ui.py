# Explanation of Maximum Depth
with st.expander("What does 'Maximum Crawl Depth' mean?"):
    st.markdown("""
    **Maximum Depth** defines how many levels deep the scanner will crawl through the website's links:
    
    - **Depth 1**: Only the base URL (e.g., `https://example.com`).
    - **Depth 2**: Links found on the base URL's page (e.g., `https://example.com/page1`, `https://example.com/page2`).
    - **Depth 3**: Links found on pages discovered in Depth 2, and so on.
    
    **Why is this important?**
    - It controls the scope and performance of the scan.
    - Prevents the scanner from endlessly crawling deep or unrelated sections of the site.
    - Focuses on the most relevant areas of the site.
